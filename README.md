# VBA-challenge
This is a repository for the VBA homework for the DU Bootcamp

In Working_Files you will find all of the sheets that I used to create the script. I started with the smallest Test_File, then worked to alpabetical_testing then finally to the largest file Multiple_year_stock_data. This method allowed me to make sure that my code was working the way that it needed to be without having to be worried abou the potential long run time associated with a larger file.

In Final_Work you will find screenshots of the Multiple_year_stock_data in the images folder. You will also find the VBA script in its own file alond with populated and unpopulated versions of the Multiple_year_stock_data file.
